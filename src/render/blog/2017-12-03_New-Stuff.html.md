After a few hours of hard work, I've made something. A website that counts down to when the [The Year 2038 Prolem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem) happens. It was quite a fun project to work on, even if it's content is not that worthwhile. You can find it [here](http://2038.gregnk.com).

Anyways onto something else. That video game I said was working on is, quite predictably, going to take longer than expected. I might not even get around to finishing that game in particular, mainly because it will most likely end up being to big and ambitious for me to properly make at this time, but that might change.
