Currently there has not been a lot of activity here. This is because I have ran into a lot of technical issues with some of my projects that I am unable to solve, I have to stay on top of school and employment, and the current pandemic situation along with other events have been taking a huge toll on my mental health. Therefore, I decided to put my software projects on hold and go on break until further notice. 

Just to confirm, **none of my projects are dead**. I will get back to working on my projects once things clear up, however I cannot give a date as to when that will happen.
