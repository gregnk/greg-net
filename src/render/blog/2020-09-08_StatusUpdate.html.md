Like the current pandemic, it seems like my personal problems won't go away. Even if it seems to temporarily recess, it eventually comes back in some way. I won't get into details here, but it has been having an effect on my motivation much like in the previous months. While I have been getting some work done, it has been going very slowly much like the last few months and I feel like I could be doing more, but I can never bring myself to work a lot of the time.

I can't even figure out how to disable the code responsible for the crashes (since MainWindow.cs is such a confusing mess that I let happen), plus I also have to stay on top of college and other stuff in my life.

I'm not really giving up on my projects, but I really don't know what to do at this point and this period of de-motivation feels endless and hard to get out of.
