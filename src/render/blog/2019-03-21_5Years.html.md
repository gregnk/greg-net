I find it hard to believe that this site has existed (in one form or another) for 5 years now, and I find it harder to believe that within that time I did barley anything with this site. Maybe it because I had a lack of ideas, or that I was aiming too high. Regardless, I got nothing done. Anyways, so I looking back at my old projects from 2017-2019 back when I was trying to make a game with Duality, while I was developing my (unfinished) games I made a series of components to make the development process easier. 

So now that I've decided that I'm not going to focus on making games entirely on my own, I have released those components as a standalone package. Hopefully someone will find them to be useful, and I will be adding more components and features to it in the near future.

I also have another project that I'm working on but I won't reveal anything now (at least not here).
