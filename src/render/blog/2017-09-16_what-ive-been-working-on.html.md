Figured I should make my yearly blog post now

Anyways, ever since I shut down and redid this entire site back in 2015 (back when this site was greg-net.net) there has basically been absolutely nothing interesting on my site. I have worked on projects and abandoned projects in the past, and at one point I was working on nothing since I really had no ideas as to what I should make, and most of the projects that I did do back when I was 12 were quite stupid (just search up greg-net.net on the web archive and you will know what I mean). But now I think I might have a few projects that wont go down the toilet after a few months. 

So the first (and biggest!) thing that im working on is a video game. I'm not going to reval much about it now since theres not much done its going to take a while because im a noob at game dev, but I did manage to develop some kind of AI for the game being based off of [3kliksphillip's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmu9PVIZBk-ZCi-Sk2F2utA) implementation in Fusion 2.5. The engine that im currently using is [Duality](http:///duality.adamslair.net).

I'm also planning out a few smaller projects, like a trig calculator and a multi-service video uploader but right now those are just ideas with absolutely no code written for them so they may not come out. There's also school, in which I have law project due this week and daily homework from math and accounting, but I tend to have a lot of free time over the weekend.

And that's all! Maybe now this site might not be completely braindead.
