So after digging through some of my old files, I found a text-based message encoding program that I made back in 2017, which I called Enigma Machine. It worked well so I figured "why not" and released it to the internet.

In case you don't know, an ["Enigma Machine"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) was a series of devices used during World War II by the axis powers to send encoded messages, and it looked like this:

In the future I might add a few more features to Enigma Machine if I feel like it, depending on if I have the time or not. Also, credit goes to my history teacher for suggesting the awesome name.

I have also been working on some other projects, but school has been a major pain in the ass so not much has been done yet. Hopefully things will be sorted out sooner than later so that I can get back to working on them.
