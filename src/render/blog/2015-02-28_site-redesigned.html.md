So I re-designed my site because the old one looked weird. Here are this list of changes:
    
* The games and downloads section were integrated with the software section.
* The header, footer and a bunch of other things changed
* News will now only be on one page, the news section
* The news section was cleaned up
* All downloads, tutorials, games are now be hidden/removed
* The site is now more small scale and just focused on software
* As with the above the tutorials and about page has been removed.
* And a whole bunch of other changes
                    
I will do other things with this site, just not often.
